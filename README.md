# foxJs

Jsout is a perfect framework of Java HTML operation, when I was in use Jsout experience is very good, with js to use the same smooth feeling, but compared to some important things, I prefer to focus on the development of the business level, the framework in the form of notes and plug-in, focus on HTML parsing, encapsulate some important work to advance;

In addition, I have made both synchronous and asynchronous versions. Different annotations will support different operation modes.

Jsout是一个很完美的java操作html的框架,我在使用jsout的时候体验非常好,用起来有着js一样的流畅感,不过相比一些不重要的东西,我更倾向于专注于业务层面的开发,这个框架以注解和插件的形式,专注于html的解析,把一些不重要的工作进行预先封装;

并且,我一共做了同步和异步两个版本,使用不同的注解就会支持不同的操作方式;

Jsout's official website document is well written, and those who have learned js will use it at first sight. If they have not learned it, they may need to spend some time to understand the structure of HTML.

Jsout的官网文档写的很好,学过js的人一看就会用,没学过的话可能要花些时间了解一下html的结构;

If you are a developer, just copy the foxjs folder into the project. Remember to configure JsOut's maven dependency.

如果你是开发者,直接把foxjs文件夹copy进工程就可以了,还有记得在配置一下JsOut的maven依赖;
